# cf_ai_news_summarizer  
AI ‑powered news summarizer using Cloudflare Workers AI and LoRA summarizer.  
This repository is a simple demonstration for the Cloudflare Software Engineering Internship optional assignment and showcases how to build an AI application on Cloudflare’s developer platform.  

## Overview  
This project allows users to submit a news article or long text via a web form and receive a concise summary generated by a large language model (LoRA summarizer) running on Workers AI. A Cloudflare Worker orchestrates the request, fetches the article contents, calls the AI model to produce a summary, and returns the result to the user. Durable Objects or KV can be used to store past summaries as session state.  

### Key components  
- **Large language model (LLM)**: uses a summarization model (e.g., Llama 3.3 fine‑tuned LoRA) hosted on Workers AI.  
- **Workflow**: a Worker script coordinates fetching the article, invoking the AI model, and storing results. A Workflow or Durable Object could be used for more complex coordination.  
- **User input**: a simple HTML page allows users to input a URL or paste text; the Worker parses the input and triggers summarization.  
- **Memory / state**: previous summaries can be stored in Durable Objects or Cloudflare KV, enabling retrieval of past queries.  

## Getting started  

### Prerequisites  
- A Cloudflare account with Workers AI access.  
- `wrangler` CLI installed.  
- Node.js v18 or later.  

### Setup  

```bash  
# Clone this repository  
git clone https://github.com/TheFrenchBaguette1/cf_ai_news_summarizer.git  
cd cf_ai_news_summarizer  

# (Optional) install dependencies if using a bundler/package manager  
npm install  

# Log in to Cloudflare and configure wrangler  
wrangler login  
# Test locally  
wrangler dev  
```  

The default Worker script in `src/index.ts` receives a POST with a URL or text, fetches the content, sends it to the summarization model via the Workers AI API, and returns the summary. Use `wrangler dev` to run the Worker locally and open `public/index.html` to test the UI.  

### Deploying  

To deploy your summarizer to Cloudflare’s network, run:  

```bash  
wrangler publish  
```  

This will build and deploy the Worker and any assets to a `workers.dev` subdomain associated with your account.  

## File structure  

- `src/index.ts` – Worker script that handles requests, calls the AI model, and returns summaries.  
- `public/index.html` – simple client for submitting URLs or text to the Worker.  
- `PROMPTS.md` – documentation of prompts used for the AI model.  
- `wrangler.toml` – configuration file for deploying with Cloudflare Workers.  

## Prompts and AI model  

See `PROMPTS.md` for details on the prompts used to instruct the summarization model.  

## Future improvements  

- Add a chat interface and conversation memory using Durable Objects.  
- Support voice input via Workers AI’s Whisper model for speech-to-text.  
- Implement caching of article fetches and summarization results to reduce latency.
